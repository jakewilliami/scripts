  Scripts for Bash et al.
</h1>


## Description

While I am beginning to look into different sorts of programming, I want to have as much experience as possible.  Hence, I have created this repository as a kind of playground for various scripts I try to write.  Be warned that not everything in here may be functional.

The present repository is found on my computer in `~/bin/`.  Ensure you make this binary repository before cloning, and clone into it, as some commands will depend on this.  Change these according to your file structure.

## Executing commands

Once the scripts have been written, you will need to add the script location to your path, and then make it exacutable.  The former can be done by:
```
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/dir' >> ~/.bash_profile
```
You may need to restart terminal after this step.  To make the script executable, simply type (in the directory of your script) 
```
chmod u+x <name_of_script>`
```
and your script will be executable (from that directory only, until you add it to your path; then it will be executable anywhere).

You only need to do the above for bash scripts (which, for ease of commandifying them, do not have a file extension).  Running other kinds of scripts may have different requirements.

Happy scripting!


## Chromatic Echos

(That sub-heading would be an awesome band name).  For reference future reference/interest, I use the terminal theme [Arthur](https://github.com/lysyi3m/macos-terminal-themes).  For information of `ls` colour output, see comments in `./python/ls.py`.


## In Case of Moving Files Around

See commit message `git show ef3086a148b7c3f129213e7b438b70d8ad53379a` for the original notes on this process.  The process of moving files *while retaining their commit history* is as follows:
1. `git filter-branch --tree-filter 'if [ -f <file_to_be_moved> ]; then mkdir <new_dir> && mv <file_to_be_moved> ./<new_dir>/<file_to_be_moved>; fi'`.  Note that this will fail if the `new_dir` already exists.
2. If you are doing this more than once, after each move, you will have to run `git update-ref -d refs/original/refs/heads/master`.
3. Once you are finished moving all of the files you need to move, push by using `git push -f origin master`.


## In Case of Finding and Replacing Text Within Files

I have had trouble replicating Unix-based `sed` solutions, so I have used perl:
```
perl -pi -e 's/<term to find>/<term to replace>/g' path/to/file(s)
```
It should be noted that you must escape any special characters with a `\`.


## In Case of Issues Executing

If bash rejects the `\r` characters they can be removed with `sed -i "" $'s/\r$//' /path/to/file`.

See commitÂ `git show e3e79ca03dc16526b486e06b7e88d8db566986e4` in branch `1.14.4` in [this repo](https://github.com/Explosive-Crayons/Electrum) for more on this.


## A Note on `cd` in Subshell

When you write `cd /path/to/dir` in a script and run it, you don't actually change working directories in your session (only in the subshell running in the script).  An easy workaround is to write
```
. <name_of_script>
```
to actually go to the directory specified in the script.  To make this less annoying, I have added to my `~/.bashrc` the following line:
```
alias <name_of_script>=". <name_of_script>"
```
which will work for the most part.  However, this causes session errors when you have options in your script (if you enter an invalid option, it will close your current session [for](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32418438/how-can-i-disable-bash-sessions-in-os-x-el-capitan) some [reason](https://www.reddit.com/r/osx/comments/397uep/changes_to_bash_sessions_and_terminal_in_el/)).  To get around this, I have added
```
exec bash
```
at the end of the script that doesn't work (see `bash/mt` and `bash/mymacros`) as an alias, and it now works.  However, this is not the [best option](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/278080/372726) (see comments by @G-Man).


## A Note on `pdfsearch` in Terminal

I have run
```
echo 'alias pdfsearch.<extension>="<program with which to run> ~/bin/scripts/pdfsearches/pdfsearch.<extension>"' >> ~/.bashrc && bash
```
For example, I ran `echo 'alias pdfsearch.rb="ruby ~/bin/scripts/pdfsearches/pdfsearch.rb"' >> ~/.bashrc && bash`, and now I can just run `pdfsearch.rb <search string>` in any directory.
