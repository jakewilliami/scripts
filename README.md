# Scripts for Bash et al.

While I am beginning to look into different sorts of programming, I want to have as much experience as possible.  Hence, I have created this repository as a kind of playground for various scripts I try to write.  Be warned that not everything in here may be functional.

### Executing commands

Once the scripts have been written, you will need to add the script location to your path (this is a trivial think in the *nix world, so look it up if you don't know how; it varies from system to system but you only have to do it once), and then make it exacutable.  To do the latter, simply type (in the directory of your script) `chmod u+x <name_of_script>`, and your script will be executable (from that directory only, until you add it to your path; then it will be executable anywhere).

Happy scripting!
