<h1 align="center">Dotfiles</h1>

_This subdirectory has been migrated to [its own repository](https://github.com/jakewilliami/configs.git/)_

This subdirectory contains all of my configuration files.

These dotfiles were initially just [`.bashrc`](.bashrc) and [`.bash_profile`](.bash_profile), hence why it is under this [`bash`](..) subdirectory.  However, over time it has grown, and I should consider migrating this to a separate repository in the future.

I may have some miscellaneous notes on these configuration files below.

## Emacs
I recently put my `.emacs` file on a Linux box I had, and realised just how annoying it is to set up.  You need to install all packages you find in the Emacs file.
