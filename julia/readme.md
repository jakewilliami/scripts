## Description
In my degree, we use [R](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/R_(programming_language)) a lot.  I have heard of [Julia](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Julia_(programming_language)) since beginning with R and [Python](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Python_(programming_language)), and think it is a good idea to play around with, considering a [course](https://www.victoria.ac.nz/courses/math/245/2020/offering?crn=7528) I am doing next year, and a [course I am just completing](https://www.victoria.ac.nz/courses/math/251/2019/offering?crn=18325) (22.10.2019).
