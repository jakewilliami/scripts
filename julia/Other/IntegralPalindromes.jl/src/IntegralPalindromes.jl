```julia
ispalindrome(n::Integer) -> Bool
```
Returns a boolean value depending on whether or not the number is a palindrome.

For example, the number `9009` is a palindrome, because (just like the palindrome strings) can be read forward and backwards the same way.

```julia
larget_palindrome(n::Int, m::Int) -> (Int..., Int)
```
Computes the largest palindrome integer that is a product of m n-digit numbers.  Will return an (m + 1)-tuple, with the numbers whose product is a palindrome, and the product of such numbers in the last position of the tuple.

For example, with n = 2 and m = 2, the largest palindrome that is the product of two 2-digit numbers is 91 Ã— 99 = 9009, so the function will return `(91, 99, 9009)`.
