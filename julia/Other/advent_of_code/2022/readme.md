# Advent of Code, 2022

Advent of Code solutions for 2022.

Using Julia to initially solve the problems in the interest of solving the problems quickly.  I may then use another language to solve the problem again, in the interest of expanding my repertoire.

## Leaderboard

There also exists a [`leaderboard/`](./leaderboard/) subdirectory, which contains helper scripts to programmatically access the work leaderboard I set up!
