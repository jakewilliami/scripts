Scripts for Python
</h1>


## Description
This is a directory in which to play around with what I see as a reasonably malleable programming language: Python.  I have used some of these programmes from this directory in other scripts (e.g., `ls.py` in `../bash/scripts`).

I have added the following to my `~/.bashrc`:
```
alias ls.py="python3 ~/bin/scripts/python/ls.py"
```
